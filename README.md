## üìÇ Notebooks Overview

| Filename                                   | Description |
|-------------------------------------------|-------------|
| `01_SampleCircuit.ipynb`                  | Introduces a basic quantum circuit using Qiskit, demonstrating how quantum gates form entangled states and how measurement collapses superposition. |
| `02_BinaryNumbers.ipynb`                  | Explores binary representation of integers and fractional numbers using Python‚Äôs built-in conversion functions. |
| `03_BooleanLogic.ipynb`                   | Demonstrates Boolean logic (AND, OR, XOR) using bitwise operations, highlighting their logical behavior and numeric interpretation. |
| `04_BitToVectors.ipynb`                   | Maps binary digits to column vectors and interprets logic gates as matrices acting on vectorized bit representations. |
| `05_ReversibleCircuits.ipynb`             | Constructs reversible classical logic gates (e.g., Toffoli) using Qiskit‚Äôs quantum circuit model, showing how classical logic can be modeled in a quantum framework. |
| `06_ProbabilisticBitsandCircuits.ipynb`   | Simulates probabilistic bits (p-bits) and multi-bit distributions, emphasizing the non-reversible nature of probabilistic logic and its deviation from classical determinism. |
